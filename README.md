# property-prices

This project was intended to compute tax efficiency in Bangalore. Data was scrapped from 99acres.com, cleaned and geocoding was done to prepare the dataset with 2000+ entries. Wherever geocoding was not possible, coordinates were manually obtained. 

The next step would be to use land-use mapping and FAR in Bangalore to predict overall prices and compare with property tax collected . But in the absence of such a file, I trained and tested on the existing dataset.
